# Solution: 405 Method Not Allowed Error on Vercel

## Problem Summary
Persistent 405 Method Not Allowed error on `/api/auth/login` endpoint when deployed to Vercel production, despite working perfectly in local development.

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, the issue was caused by **Next.js 14 App Router serverless function optimization** combined with **Vercel's compilation and routing layer**.

### The Core Issues:

1. **Module-Level Client Initialization**
   - The `getSupabaseClient()` helper function was being optimized by Next.js/Webpack
   - During compilation, the Supabase client was initialized at module level instead of per-request
   - This caused the compiled route to behave unexpectedly on Vercel's serverless environment

2. **Missing Vercel-Specific Configuration**
   - No explicit function memory/duration settings in `vercel.json`
   - Missing route-level CORS headers configuration
   - Vercel's routing layer wasn't properly recognizing the HTTP method handlers

3. **Static Optimization Attempts**
   - Despite `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`, Next.js was still attempting some optimization
   - Missing `revalidate = false` export allowed potential caching issues

## The Solution

### 1. Updated Route Handler (`app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Added explicit revalidation control
export const revalidate = false

// Moved Supabase initialization INSIDE the POST handler (not at module level)
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const supabase = createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
  )
  // ... rest of the handler
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Prevents module-level initialization that gets cached incorrectly
- Ensures fresh Supabase client per request
- Forces truly dynamic behavior

### 2. Enhanced Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)

**Added:**
```javascript
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/api/:path*',
      headers: [
        { key: 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', value: 'true' },
        { key: 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', value: '*' },
        { key: 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods', value: 'GET,DELETE,PATCH,POST,PUT,OPTIONS' },
        // ... other CORS headers
      ],
    },
  ]
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Configures CORS at the Next.js build level
- Ensures all API routes get proper headers before Vercel deployment
- Helps Vercel's edge network understand route capabilities

### 3. Comprehensive Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

**Added:**
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "memory": 1024,
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "value": "GET,OPTIONS,PATCH,DELETE,POST,PUT" },
        // ... other CORS headers
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Explicitly tells Vercel how to handle API route functions
- Sets proper memory allocation for bcryptjs operations
- Configures CORS at Vercel's routing layer (redundant but ensures coverage)
- Makes HTTP methods explicitly available to Vercel's edge network

## Technical Deep Dive

### What Was Happening in the Compiled Code

When examining `.next/server/app/api/auth/login/route.js`, we found:

```javascript
let P=(0,d.eI)("https://abmznacsmekugtgagdnk.supabase.co",process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
```

This showed the Supabase client `P` was initialized at module scope in the compiled output, even though we had a function wrapper. This is because:

1. Webpack/SWC optimized the helper function call
2. The client was created once during cold start
3. Subsequent requests reused the stale client
4. This caused routing issues on Vercel's serverless infrastructure

### Why It Worked Locally But Not on Vercel

**Local Development:**
- Hot reload creates new instances frequently
- Node.js runtime handles module caching differently
- Development server doesn't use edge network routing

**Vercel Production:**
- Serverless functions are frozen and reused
- Module-level initialization happens once per container
- Edge network caching adds another layer
- Stricter HTTP method validation

## Verification Steps

After deploying, verify the fix by:

1. **Test POST Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-riview.vercel.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"test123"}'
```

2. **Test OPTIONS Request (CORS Preflight):**
```bash
curl -X OPTIONS https://ai-riview.vercel.app/api/auth/login -v
```

3. **Check Response Headers:**
Should see:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,OPTIONS,PATCH,DELETE,POST,PUT`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- Status: 200 (for POST with valid creds) or 204 (for OPTIONS)

## What We Tried Before (That Didn't Work)

1. Deleting middleware.ts
2. Adding OPTIONS handler only
3. Adding CORS headers to responses only
4. Using `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` alone
5. Using `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` alone
6. Moving Supabase imports around

**Why These Didn't Work:**
- They addressed symptoms, not the root cause
- Didn't prevent module-level optimization
- Didn't configure Vercel's routing layer properly

## Lessons Learned

1. **Next.js 14 App Router Gotchas:**
   - Helper functions can be optimized away
   - Always initialize clients inside route handlers for serverless
   - Use `revalidate = false` in addition to `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

2. **Vercel Deployment Best Practices:**
   - Configure functions explicitly in `vercel.json`
   - Set CORS headers at multiple levels (Next.js + Vercel)
   - Test compiled output in `.next/server` directory
   - Use `ƒ (Dynamic)` marker in build output as verification

3. **Debugging Serverless Issues:**
   - Check compiled JavaScript, not just TypeScript source
   - Local behavior doesn't guarantee production behavior
   - Module-level code behaves differently in serverless vs traditional Node.js

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Route handler fixes
2. `next.config.js` - Added headers() configuration
3. `vercel.json` - Added functions and headers configuration

## Build Verification

After changes, build output should show:
```
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
...
├ ƒ /api/auth/login                      0 B                0 B
...

ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

The `ƒ (Dynamic)` marker confirms the route is properly configured for dynamic rendering.

## Prevention for Future Routes

When creating new API routes in Next.js 14 App Router for Vercel deployment:

1. **Always use these exports:**
```typescript
export const runtime = 'nodejs' // If using Node.js-specific APIs
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
export const revalidate = false
```

2. **Initialize clients inside handlers:**
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const client = createClient(...) // Inside, not outside
  // ...
}
```

3. **Test the build:**
```bash
npm run build
# Check for ƒ (Dynamic) marker
```

4. **Verify vercel.json includes the route pattern:**
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": { "memory": 1024, "maxDuration": 10 }
  }
}
```
